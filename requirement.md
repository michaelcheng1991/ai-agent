# Technical Design Document: AI-Powered Financial Advisor Training Platform

## Overview

### Scope
This platform enables senior financial advisors to upload domain knowledge and let agenst in training to practice client interactions with AI-simulated customer personas. 
The system evaluates agents' performance based on their ability to apply appropriate knowledge in context. 
This design focuses on the core MVP flow while planning for future expansion.

### Non-scope
we are not testing communication skills

## prioritized discussion
- is there any existing tech stacks or built platform that supports course and feedback system?
- is there any existing tech stack for fast persona building?
- real time ai audio chat?
