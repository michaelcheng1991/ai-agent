# Technical Design Document: AI-Powered Financial Advisor Training Platform

## Overview

### Scope
The Web Platform enables senior financial advisors to Customize training materials, AI customer persona to evaluate trainee's knowledge retention and service recommendation skills.

### Non-scope
we are not testing communication skills

## prioritized discussion
- is there any existing tech stacks or built platform that supports course and feedback system?
- is there any existing tech stack for fast persona building?
- real time ai audio chat?

## High Level Flows 

The key flow is for financial advisors to upload domain knowledge and let agents in training to chat with an ai customer persona and test agents' ability to apply the domain knowledge given specific context. After the chat session, the agent will be given a score in certain areas.

## Goal
Have agents ready in as short of a timeline
