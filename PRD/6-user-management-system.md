- **User Profile Manager**: Manages user profile information and preferences
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Controls access to system features based on roles
- **Organization Manager**: Handles organization-level administration
- **Subscription Service**: Manages payment processing and subscription status
- **User API**: Exposes endpoints for user management operations
